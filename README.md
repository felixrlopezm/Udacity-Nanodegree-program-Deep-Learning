# Flowers Image Classifier
Final project for the Udacity Nanodegree program: Deep Learning. A first neural network for predicting daily bike rental ridership.

In this project and in the framework of the aformentioned Udacity nanodegree program, I build a neural network to carry out a prediction about daily bike rental ridership on a real dataset! I apply forwardpass gradient descent, backpropagation and other related concepts directly with python code (and without using any other higher-level tool such as PyTorch). 

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset

The network is trained and used by means of a Jupyter Notebook written in python: "Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb"

The neural network itself is built in the pytho file: "my_answers.py"

## How to install and run the code
Just clone the repository in your working directory, open the Jupyter Notebook and run it.
